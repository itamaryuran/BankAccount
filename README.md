# BankAccount
A task in thread programming
In this task I have built a bank system. The bank contains accounts, transactions, tellers and so on. 
running the program will initiate 10 bank accounts, 10 tellers and a pool of transactions. tellers will get transactions from the pool and 
will execute them simultaniasly using thread programming
